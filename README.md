# MongoDB Practice Repository

Welcome to the **MongoDB Practice Repository**! This repository is designed to help you master MongoDB by practicing CRUD operations, aggregation pipelines, indexing, array operations, and more. It includes realistic datasets, example queries, and problem-based exercises.

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`sample_data/`**  
  Contains JSON datasets for practice, such as employee details, books, student records, and more.  
  - `employees.json`: Dataset with over 100 documents, including nested documents and arrays.
  - `books.json`: These questions are based on the analysis of a collection containing book documents with fields such as `_id`, `title`, `isbn`, `pageCount`, `publishedDate`, `thumbnailUrl`, `shortDescription`, `longDescription`, `status`, `authors`, and `categories`..

- **`questions/`**  
  Problem-based MongoDB practice questions in Markdown format.

## üìñ Topics Covered

### 1. CRUD Operations  
Learn to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from collections with practical exercises.

### 2. Query Operators  
Master MongoDB operators like `$eq`, `$ne`, `$gte`, `$lte`, `$in`, `$regex`, and more.

### 3. Array Operations  
Understand how to work with arrays using `$push`, `$pop`, `$addToSet`, `$unwind`, and `$elemMatch`.

### 4. Aggregation Pipelines  
Practice building complex aggregation queries using `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$lookup`, and `$bucket`.

### 5. Indexing  
Learn to optimize query performance by creating single-field and compound indexes.

## üöÄ Load the Data into MongoDB

### Steps to Import Data:
1. Start your MongoDB server.

2. Use the `mongoimport` tool to load the dataset into your MongoDB instance:

   ```
   mongoimport --db practice_db --collection employees --file sample_data/books.json --jsonArray
   ```
3. Verify the data has been imported correctly:

    ```
    use practice_db
    db.employees.find().pretty()
    ```

## üìù Exercises

### CRUD Operations
- Insert new documents into the collection.
- Update documents using `$set`, `$unset`, and `$rename`.
- Delete specific documents using `$match`.

### Query Operators
- Retrieve documents with complex filter conditions.
- Perform text searches with `$regex`.

### Aggregation Pipelines
- Group documents by a specific field.
- Create custom fields using `$addFields`.
- Perform lookups to join collections.

### Indexing
- Create indexes and analyze query performance with `$explain`.
- Use compound indexes for multi-field queries.
